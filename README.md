## 💡 Why This Matters for Data Science

Understanding the math behind ML algorithms helps you:
- Debug models more effectively
- Choose appropriate algorithms for your data
- Optimize hyperparameters with confidence
- Innovate beyond existing libraries

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, SciPy, SymPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📖 Learning Path

    A[Linear Algebra Basics] --> B[Calculus Fundamentals]
    B --> C[Statistics & Probability]
    C --> D[Optimization Methods]
    D --> E[ML Math Foundations]
```

**Recommended Order:**
1. Start with **Linear Algebra** (vectors, matrices)
2. Move to **Calculus** (derivatives, gradients)
3. Study **Statistics** (distributions, inference)
4. Apply to **Optimization** (gradient descent, etc.)
